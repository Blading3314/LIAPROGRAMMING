/**
 * The TransportMode enumeration lists the standard ways a person
 * can move during an activity in this program.
 * 
 * This allows the program to keep track of how each activity was performed,
 * and to group or compare activities by their mode of transport.
 * 
 * The available options are:
 * - WALKING
 * - RUNNING
 * - BIKING
 * - SWIMMING
 * - SKATING
 * 
 * If an activity uses a different mode (like 'SCOOTERING'), you can add it as a custom mode elsewhere in the program.
